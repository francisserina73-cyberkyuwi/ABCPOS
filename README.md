# 🎉 ABC POS System - Supabase Version

## ✅ Migration Complete - 100%!

Your POS system has been successfully migrated from PHP/MySQL to Supabase (JavaScript/PostgreSQL).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Supabase (20 minutes)
Follow the detailed guide: **`POST_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

Quick steps:
1. Create account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create new project
3. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
4. Create storage bucket `product-images`
5. Create admin user
6. Copy credentials

### 2. Configure Project (5 minutes)

Create `.env` file:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
VITE_SITE_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```

`VITE_SITE_URL` should match the domain where the app is deployed (e.g., your Vercel URL) so that Supabase password-reset emails never fall back to `http://localhost`.

Install and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main

# Deploy on vercel.com
# - Connect GitHub repo
# - Add environment variables
# - Deploy
```

## 💳 GCash Payments

The Orders tab now supports native GCash QR checkout for both admins and cashiers. Configure your wallet details through the Vite environment file so the generated QR includes the right account info:

```env
VITE_GCASH_ACCOUNT_NAME="ABC Bakery"
VITE_GCASH_ACCOUNT_NUMBER="09XXXXXXXXX"
VITE_GCASH_MESSAGE="Scan to pay via GCash"
VITE_GCASH_REFERENCE_PREFIX="GCASH-QR"
```

If these keys are missing the UI falls back to demo values, but updating them ensures the QR code, reference tags, and receipts reflect your real GCash account.

Flow:
- Select **GCash QR** in the payment section (available to admin & cashier roles).
- Show the QR, let the customer scan, then mark the payment as received.
- Checkout stays disabled until the payment is confirmed, ensuring every order records the method, status, optional reference number, and (optionally) a QR payload/metadata.

---

### Static GCash QR option

If you already have an official GCash QR image, drop it into `assets/gcash-qr.png` (or update the path in `orders.html`) and the modal will display that exact image instead of generating one on the fly. Cashiers still need to click **Payment Received** so the order unlocks and the correct payment status is stored.
